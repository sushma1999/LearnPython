**Week 1: Getting Started**

* **Day 1-2:** 
    * **Introduction to Python:** What is Python, its uses, and why it's popular.
    * **Setting up your environment:** Install Python and choose a code editor (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.).
    * **Basic syntax:** Learn about variables, data types (numbers, strings, booleans), and simple input/output using `print()` and `input()`.
    * **Practice:** Write simple programs to print messages, perform basic calculations, and get user input.

* **Day 3-5:**
    * **Control flow:** Understand `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements for decision-making.
    * **Loops:** Learn about `for` and `while` loops for repeating tasks.
    * **Practice:** Write programs using conditional statements and loops (e.g., calculate the factorial of a number, check if a number is prime).

* **Day 6-7:**
    * **Functions:** Learn how to define and use functions to organize your code.
    * **Practice:** Create functions to perform specific tasks (e.g., calculate the area of a circle, convert temperature units).

**Week 2: Data Structures**

* **Day 1-3:**
    * **Lists:** Learn about lists and how to manipulate them (adding, removing, accessing elements).
    * **Tuples:** Understand tuples and their immutability.
    * **Practice:** Write programs to work with lists and tuples (e.g., create a shopping list, store student information).

* **Day 4-5:**
    * **Dictionaries:** Learn about dictionaries (key-value pairs) and their uses.
    * **Sets:** Understand sets and their unique properties.
    * **Practice:** Use dictionaries and sets in your programs (e.g., create a phonebook, find unique elements in a list).

* **Day 6-7:**
    * **Strings:** Dive deeper into string manipulation (slicing, formatting, searching).
    * **Practice:** Solve problems involving string operations (e.g., reverse a string, count the occurrences of a word).

**Week 3: File Handling and Modules**

* **Day 1-2:**
    * **File handling:** Learn how to read from and write to files.
    * **Practice:** Create programs to read data from a file, process it, and write the results to another file.

* **Day 3-5:**
    * **Modules and packages:** Understand how to organize your code into modules and use external libraries.
    * **Practice:** Import and use modules from the standard library (e.g., `math`, `random`, `datetime`).

* **Day 6-7:**
    * **Exception handling:** Learn how to handle errors gracefully using `try`, `except`, and `finally`.
    * **Practice:** Write code that includes error handling to prevent crashes.

**Week 4: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

* **Day 1-3:**
    * **Introduction to OOP:** Learn about classes, objects, attributes, and methods.
    * **Practice:** Create simple classes to represent real-world objects (e.g., a car, a bank account).

* **Day 4-5:**
    * **Inheritance and polymorphism:** Understand how to create hierarchies of classes and override methods.
    * **Practice:** Build a program using inheritance (e.g., create a `Animal` class and derive `Dog` and `Cat` classes from it).

* **Day 6-7:**
    * **Review and mini-project:** Review the concepts learned so far and start working on a small project to apply your knowledge.

**Additional Tips**

* **Practice regularly:** The key to learning programming is practice. Code every day, even if it's just for a few minutes.
* **Start small:** Don't try to build complex projects right away. Start with small, manageable tasks and gradually increase the complexity.
* **Use online resources:** There are plenty of online tutorials, courses, and exercises available to help you learn Python.
* **Join communities:** Connect with other Python learners and developers through online forums, social media groups, or local meetups.
* **Don't give up:** Learning programming takes time and effort. Don't get discouraged if you encounter challenges. Keep practicing and you'll eventually succeed.

**Remember:** This is just a suggested plan. Feel free to adjust it based on your own pace and learning style. The most important thing is to be consistent and have fun along the way!

**Happy learning!**
