**1. Ensure Python is Installed**

* Open your terminal (or command prompt) and type `python --version`. 
* If you see a version number (e.g., `Python 3.11.4`), you're good to go. Otherwise, download and install the latest Python version from the official website ([https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/)).

**2. Open VS Code**

* Launch Visual Studio Code.

**3. Create a New File**

* Click on "File" -> "New File" or use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+N`.

**4. Save the File**

* Click on "File" -> "Save" or press `Ctrl+S`.
* Choose a location on your computer to save the file.
* Name the file something descriptive (e.g., `hello_world.py`). Make sure to include the `.py` extension.

**5. Write Your Python Code**

* In the newly created file, type the following code:

```python
print("Hello, world!") 
```

**6. Run the Code**

* There are a couple of ways to run your Python code in VS Code:

   * **Right-click and Run:**
     * Right-click anywhere within the code editor.
     * Select "Run Python File in Terminal" from the context menu.
     * This will open a terminal at the bottom of VS Code and execute your code. You should see the output "Hello, world!" in the terminal.

   * **Use the Play Button:**
     * In the top-right corner of the code editor, you'll likely see a green "Play" button. 
     * Click on it to run your code.
     * Similar to the right-click method, this will execute your code and display the output in the terminal.

**Explanation of the Code**

* `print("Hello, world!")`:
    * `print()` is a built-in Python function.
    * It takes whatever is inside the parentheses and displays it on the console (the terminal in this case).
    * In our example, it's displaying the text "Hello, world!".

**Tips**

* **Select the Right Python Interpreter:** If you have multiple versions of Python installed, VS Code might prompt you to select the one you want to use for this project. Choose the appropriate version.
* **Install the Python Extension:** If you haven't already, search for and install the official "Python" extension from Microsoft in the VS Code extensions marketplace. It adds a ton of helpful features for Python development. 
* **Experiment!** Try changing the text inside the `print()` function and re-running the code to see how the output changes.

**Next Steps**

* Now that you've created and run your first Python program, you can start exploring more complex concepts and building more interesting projects. There are tons of online resources and tutorials available to guide you on your Python journey!
